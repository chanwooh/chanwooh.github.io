                            But I love this photo because we can do sorta feminine things together and you won’t judge me!! Instead, we have fun poking fun at how feminine my waists are and how I might be wearing women’s jeans all the time lol.

                            I love these photos because they remind me that even though we’re both J’s, we can also be very spontaneous and still have really fun dates. This was one of my favorite dates because I just remember us talking and laughing like the whole time we were together, plus we had great food which always helps.

                            I love this photo because it reminds me of us with everyone we love! I love that we are close to the same people, but that we are friends with everyone independent from our relationship. I love that we aren’t super PDA and simpy in front of everyone, but there are little moments when I catch your eye and know that this moment is even better because both of us are here together. Also, you look so good in a swimsuit :O
